I am Vaibhav Upadhyay, a final year IDDDP (B.Tech. Aerospace Engineering + M.Tech. Centre for Systems and Control) student at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I am privileged to be under the supervision of Prof. Debasish Chatterjee, who has been mentoring me for the past two years, and I am also grateful to Dr. Siddhartha Ganguly, whose mentorship has complemented this journey. Their combined support has been instrumental in shaping my academic growth. Outside academics, I enjoy trekking and nature photography as hobbies, capturing the world through my lens whenever I get the chance. Some of my favourite shots can be found here.
